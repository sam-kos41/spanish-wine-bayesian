- [ ] No hardcoded paths (except data folder)
- [ ] Code follows consistent style

### ‚úÖ Documentation
- [ ] README.md is complete with badges
- [ ] Installation instructions are clear
- [ ] Example outputs provided (EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.md)
- [ ] Data source properly credited (Kaggle link)

### ‚úÖ Repository Setup
- [ ] .gitignore configured (excludes data, cache, .DS_Store)
- [ ] requirements.R lists all dependencies
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow configured
- [ ] License file present (MIT recommended)

### ‚úÖ Data Management

## GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create New Repository**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git (if not already done)
   git init
   
   # Add remote
   git remote add origin https://github.com/sam-kos41/spanish-wine-bayesian.git
   ```

2. **Initial Commit**
   ```bash
   # Add all files except those in .gitignore
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Bayesian hierarchical analysis of Spanish wines"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Repository Settings (on GitHub)

1. **About Section**
   - Description: "Bayesian hierarchical analysis comparing Spanish wine regions using custom MCMC"
   - Topics: `r`, `bayesian-statistics`, `mcmc`, `data-analysis`, `wine`, `hierarchical-models`
   - Website: Link to your portfolio

2. **README Preview**
   - Ensure badges render correctly
   - Check that images/plots display (if included)

3. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional)
   - Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: main branch
   - This will host your HTML output

## Portfolio Presentation Tips

### LinkedIn Post Template
```
üç∑ New Portfolio Project: Bayesian Analysis of Spanish Wines

Implemented a custom Gibbs sampler in R to compare critic scores across 5 Spanish wine regions. Key findings:

‚Ä¢ Ribera del Duero leads in budget wines ($15-20)
‚Ä¢ Regional effects explain ~15% of score variance
‚Ä¢ 5,000 MCMC iterations converge in <1 second

Tech: R, Bayesian hierarchical models, custom MCMC

```

### Resume Bullet Points
```
‚Ä¢ Developed Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze 1,500+ Spanish wine ratings, implementing custom Gibbs sampler achieving <1s runtime for 5,000 MCMC iterations

‚Ä¢ Built parameterized R Markdown pipeline with automated report generation, identifying statistically significant regional differences in wine quality (15% variance explained)
```

## Final Quality Checks

Before sharing:
1. [ ] Run analysis with both budget_mode=TRUE and FALSE
2. [ ] Verify all outputs generate correctly
3. [ ] Test installation on clean R environment
4. [ ] Review README for typos/clarity
5. [ ] Ensure GitHub Actions pass (green checkmark)

## Making it Stand Out

Consider adding (future enhancements):
- Interactive Shiny dashboard
- Additional regions or countries
- Time series analysis of scores
- Price prediction model
- Docker container for reproducibility
